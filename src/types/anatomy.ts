/**
 * Anatomy types — segments, sides, and competency states.
 *
 * A *segment* is a named anatomical region on a vascular diagram (e.g. the
 * great saphenous vein in the thigh). Each study type owns its own list of
 * segments, which is why `SegmentId` is a plain `string` rather than an
 * enum — the allowed values are determined by the `StudyType`.
 *
 * *Competency* describes the clinical state of a venous segment:
 *   - Normal       — continent / filled black in diagrams
 *   - Ablated      — previously treated / hollow with outline
 *   - Incompetent  — reflux present / filled red
 *   - Inconclusive — insufficient data / filled gray
 *
 * For arterial studies, competency is reinterpreted as stenosis severity
 * via the `ArterialStenosis` grade, but the underlying `Competency` shape
 * is reused for the diagram overlay (see pdfTheme competency colors).
